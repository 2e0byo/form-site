              Think back to the beginning of the course.  How does where you are now
              compare to where you were then: do you find it easier/harder to
              think/talk about these things?  Do you feel like you have more of a
              grasp of what’s going on, or do the problems seem larger?  Do you feel
              more confident in your understanding, or does it all seem a chaotic
              muddle?  Can you think of anything which has contributed to being this
              way?

              Can you think of an example of something which has and hasn’t
